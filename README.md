# ecoswash_move_group_interface_v2
This is the scecond version of our original ecoswash_move_group_interface repository. The original repo has the working but dirty code to command the robot go to certain positions and take 15 different orientations at this pose. This was developed to test lidar and radar in the cell. 

The current v2 version is attempted to clean the code by removing all the global definitions and function in the main() function to a header and a helper source file.
